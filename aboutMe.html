                My name is Aanandan Biswas. 
                I am in 7th grade. 
                I have many hobbies like playing video games, coding etc. 
                I also am learning coding from White Hat junior. 
                I have learnt many things from white hat junior like how to create games with javascript and also how to create websites with HTML and then stylise them to my liking with CSS. 
                In the previous page you were seeing many of my games created with javascript.
